# Anti-Money-Laundering-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods

This project aims to detect money laundering activities using supervised machine learning techniques. Money laundering is a process where illicit gains are made to appear legitimate, posing a severe threat to financial institutions and national economies. This project classifies transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent using real transaction datasets. I have used supervised machine learning to classify the transactions into fraudulent or not fraudulent based on data such as change in balance, incoming and outgoing foreign and domestic
transactions. The methods implemented include Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for handling imbalanced data, and machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. The results obtained through analysis are very significant and these models can achieve accuracies like Random Forest - 92.5%, Logistic Regression - 93.3%.
